# Blackout-Controller | Communications Satellite Simulator
## Overview
This project involves simulating a satellite communication network where satellites and devices interact based on their positions, ranges, and capabilities, including relay satellite functionality, to facilitate communication while adhering to specified constraints and behaviours.
- Utilized Java to design a satellite communication simulator for a futuristic society, using strict OOP design principles.
- Crafted a dynamic backend model to manage file uploads/downloads, satellite movement, and device interactions.
- Integrated a frontend interface for the satellite simulator, utilizing RESTful API endpoints to handle various HTTP requests.

## Features
- Create and remove handheld, laptop, and desktop devices.
- Create and remove standard, teleporting, and relay satellites.
- Simulate movement of satellites and file transfer processes.
- Handle file transfers with bandwidth and storage constraints.
- Simulate the connection reachability between devices and satellites.
